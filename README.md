# COVID_cases_vs_tests

This project presents a study about the relation between the covid-19 cases and the testing observed in Brazil. Data from each state of Brazil are analysed in monthly basis for the ear 2021. Regression techniques are applied to identify the relation between the relative number of tests (per 100k inhabitants) and the positive cases observed in the dataset. Europe data is used as a reference basis, considering the same time period in countries of the EU.

The results show that the Brazilian data presents strong correlation between testing and postive covid cases observed. In fact, a linear regression with R^2=0.41 attests the positive relation between these variables with a factor equals 0.217. Whereas the reference data, from the EU countries, show no statistical relevant relation between tests and covid cases.

These results indicate that Brazil does not apply a sufficient number of tests, since any increase in the relative number of testing results in a average increase in the number of postive covid cases. On the other hand, countries that apply a higher relative number of tests show no relation between such variables.
